This driver is for Intel i915 compatible graphic cards.

Default behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When no configuration is provided to the driver, it will switch on all devices
the graphic card is initially connected to. It will use the best resolution as
provided by the BIOS or EDID information from the display devices for each
connector. The virtual resolution delivered to the client is the maximum in
width and height of the different connectors. The framebuffer memory is
directly exported to the client of the driver. When newly connected devices are
detected by the hardware, the new connectors are enabled, probed, and again the
'best' resolution will be chosen for the device. Nevertheless, it won't have an
effect on the virtual resolution.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each of the connector can be configured explicitly in terms of resolution and
whether it should be enabled or not. This looks like the following:

! <config>
!   <connector name="LVDS-11" width="1280" height="800" enabled="true"/>
! </config>

When the configuration changes during run-time, the driver will adapt to it. In
this case it will also change the current virtual resolution to the maximum of
the configured resolutions in width and height, and it will inform its client
about the change in resolution.

It is possible to run the driver in 'buffered' mode, which means it does not
export the framebuffer memory directly to the client, but provides a simple RAM
dataspace instead. The copying from the RAM dataspace to the framebuffer memory
is done by the framebuffer driver when triggered by a refresh operation. This
option can alleviate tearing effects, and has to be enabled via the
configuration like this:

! <config buffered="yes"/>

To present all available connectors and their possible resolutions to the user
the driver is able to export a corresponding report ROM. This has to be
configured too, like in the following:

! <config>
!   <report connectors="yes"/>
! </config>

The exported report has the following format:

! <connectors>
!   <connector name="LVDS-11" connected="1">
!     <mode width="1280" height="800" hz="60"/>
!     ...
!   </connector>
!   ...
! </connectors>
